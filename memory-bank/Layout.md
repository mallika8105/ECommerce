# `src/components/Layout.tsx` Context File

## Purpose
This file defines a `Layout` component that provides a consistent structure for public-facing pages of the e-commerce application. It includes a `Navbar` at the top, a `Footer` at the bottom, and a main content area where child routes are rendered.

## Key Components/Functions
- **`Layout` Component:** A functional React component that renders the `Navbar`, `main` content area, and `Footer`.
- **`Outlet`:** A component from `react-router-dom` that is used to render the child route's element. This allows nested routes to display their content within the parent route's layout.

## Dependencies
- `react`: Core React library.
- `react-router-dom`: For routing capabilities, specifically `Outlet`.
- `./Navbar`: The navigation bar component.
- `./Footer`: The footer component.

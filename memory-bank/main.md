# `src/main.tsx` Context File

## Purpose
This file is the primary entry point for rendering the React application into the DOM. It initializes the React application and mounts the root `App` component.

## Key Components/Functions
- **`createRoot`:** From `react-dom/client`, this function creates a React root for concurrent mode rendering.
- **`render`:** Renders the `App` component within a `StrictMode` wrapper into the HTML element with the ID 'root'.
- **`StrictMode`:** A React development tool that helps identify potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

## Dependencies
- `react`: Core React library (specifically `StrictMode`).
- `react-dom/client`: For DOM manipulation and rendering React components.
- `./index.css`: Global CSS styles for the application.
- `./App.tsx`: The main application component that defines routing and overall structure.
